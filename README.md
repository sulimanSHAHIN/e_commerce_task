Built an e-commerce with (all product, category and cart)tab 
Search based on title and description 
filter based on (minimum rate,price range ,title sorting,price sorting and rate sorting)
Wishlist page
Using redux toolkit for API state
Centralized state for cart, wishlist, categories, and products.

Slices were created for:

cartSlice: manage cart items, quantities

wishlistSlice: manage wishlist items with toggle logic

categoriesSlice: store categories fetched from API

productSlice: store all products

- I think it would be better if i add cart svg button like next to wishlist button instead of tab
-implementing cart management or filter type as sidebar is a good UI idea
